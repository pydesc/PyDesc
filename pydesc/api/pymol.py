"""
Package providing functions for visualization of some PyDesc features in PyMOL.

Usage:
    - make sure Python used by PyMOL has PyDesc installed (how? see below)
    - simply import pydesc in PyMOL console and create objects or use PyMOL to
    execute scripts using pydesc library
    - import pydesc.api.pymol and use its functions to visualize pydesc objects

How to install PyDesc in PyMOL's Python?
Either use pip in PyMOL console or build PyMOL (
https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source/blob/master) with PREFIX_PATH
variable set to path storing already install PyDesc.

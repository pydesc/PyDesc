PyDesc Warnings and Exceptions.

Usage: to use Exceptions simply import this module and raise them.
To use configurable warnings import this module and use static method warn
in class Warn.
In configuration manager set filter values in branch warnings.class_filters.
<Warning Class> to one of values from list below:
error -- raises error instead of printing warning.
ignore -- skips warnings.
always -- always prints warnings.

Exception classes:
DiscontinuityError -- exceptions raised when chain discontinuity is found.
WrongAtomDistances -- exceptions raised when wrong distances between atoms
occurs in monomer.

Warnings classes:
CopyDownload -- information about creation of local copy of file from data
base.
Info -- any information.
DeprecationWarning -- warning against unsupported methods.
LocalCopyAccess -- information about access to local copy of file.
MonomerCreationFailed -- information about failure during monomer creation.
NoConfiguration -- information about lack of configuration in config manager.
UnknownParticleName -- information about occurrence of particle of unknown
name.
UserWarning -- default warning.
